Notes on Mary S. Morgan's Book, Chapter 3

1. Intro.
The Edgeworth box introduced new concepts. It is primarily a tool for theorizing. Form, content and history of the model can be taken as examples for the history of modeling in general.
Mathematics is only one language in which a model can be expressed, but it plays a special role in modeling.
Mathematics and modeling are new ways of expressing economic ideas, which lead to new economic concepts being imagined.
Visualization is imagining the world and making an image of it. As far as I understand imagining means growing a model from the bottom up by coming up with new concepts and making an image is reducing the world to a simpler image of it that can be displayed.

2. Acts of Translation
Translating economic ideas from verbal to mathematical form is not simple.
In translating economic ideas one has to decide into which mathematical language to translate and what is exactly to be translated.
Seemingly equivalent mathematical languages like supply and demand diagrams and systems of equations are not equivalent. Instead of translating, economist try to represent the aspects about the world that interest them in appropriate form.
Mathematical models help economists in understanding how the world works, because the manipulation of symbols "aids to the human memory and imagination" (Fisher 1982).
Model making should not be seen as Translation or Transcription but as a way of understanding the world (cognition).
Making models requires perceiving the world as it is, but also coming up with new concepts. Model making is trying to understand how the world works and express that understanding in new forms. The preceding sentence also expresses a very broad definition of visualization.

3. Making the mathematical economic world in models
In order to create mathematical models, economists need mathematical representations of the world. In the example of Ricardo's model farm these representations are things that can be numerically measured in the real world like prices or wages. Edgeworth used abstract concepts like indifference curves, that had to be imagined before he could use them in his model (making an image of them). The relationships between these new concepts are note determined by math alone but by the model made by the economist.
Model making requires the same qualities as making mathematical images of the world. Coming up with new concepts and representing them in a language. Model making lead to new representations that enabled the economists to build a mathematical version of the world.

4.The artist's space versus the economist's space
Philosophers of science often think of model making as a process of "simplification, isolation, abstraction" (p.101).
This is a process of perception and illustration.
Modern economists build up their model worlds from simple elements. This is a process of visualization, in other words understanding the world and coming up with new elements to represent it.
Illustration takes part in the perceptual space of the artist. Visualization takes part in the conceptual space of the economist.
if the reasoning and the diagram both take part in the conceptual space, i.e. by manipulating economic concepts, the diagram plays a vital role in the argument If the diagram is in the perceptual space, the reasoning is "off the diagram‚Äù (Mahoney 1985).

6.ii  Newness
Modeling enables economists to say different things about the world than verbal economics. Visualization creates a new world with new concepts. Verbal descriptions of mathematical models are possible but they need names for the new concepts developed during the process of creating the model. Modeling individual behavior as the outcome of optimization behavior is such a new concept, which makes use of the mathematical technique of optimization but can also be expressed verbally. In the context of visual models, a model contributes something new if it cannot be omitted from the text without something missing. This means that the model adds new concepts to the discussion.

7.  Seeing the World in the Model
The move from sentences to diagrams can be regarded as a bigger step than the move from sentences to algebra. Sentences express temporal or logical relations. Diagrams express local or spatial relations. In my opinion this is wrong. Diagrams can map temporal or logical relations into spatial or local relations. But maybe this is what she means.
The difference between languages is not in the symbols but in the relations used to manipulate them. 
Once the diagram is conceived the perceptual elements help in understanding the conceptual relations of the elements once the diagram is conceived. Economists do not go from seeing the world to making an image of it but from imagining how it might be and visualizing it in a model.
